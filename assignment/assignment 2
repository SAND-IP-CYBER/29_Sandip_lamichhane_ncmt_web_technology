CHAPTER 2: WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)
1. Define the term ”Sitemap” in the planning phase.
Answer:A sitemap in the planning phase is a visual or written representation of a website’s structure that outlines all the pages and shows how they are organized
  and linked together, helping designers and developers plan clear navigation, logical content flow, and an effective overall site layout before development begins.
2. What is the purpose of the ”Launch” phase in web development?
Answer:The launch phase in web development is the stage where the completed website is made live and accessible to users after final testing, fixes, and approvals.
  Its purposeis to deploy the site to the server, ensure everything functions correctly in a real environment, and officially release the website for public use.
3. Why is ”Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?
Answer:Documentation is important in the development lifecycle because it records system requirements, design decisions, code functionality, and processes,
 making the project easier to understand, maintain, and update. It helps developers, testers, and future teams work efficiently, reduces errors, supports troubleshooting,
 and ensures continuity even when team members change.
4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
Answer:Front-end development focuses on the parts of a website that users see and interact with directly, such as layout, design, buttons, and navigation,
  using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development, on the other hand, handles the server-side functionality that users do not see,
  including databases, servers, application logic, and user authentication, ensuring the website works correctly behind the scenes.
Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)
5. ”Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase.
Answer: Planning is the most critical phase of web development because it lays the foundation for the entire project and helps avoid costly mistakes later.
 Key activities performed during the planning phase include defining the website’s goals and objectives, identifying the target audience, gathering and analyzing 
 requirements, creating a sitemap to organize pages and navigation, planning content and functionality, selecting appropriate technologies, setting timelines and budgets,
 and identifying potential risks. Effective planning ensures the project is well-structured, efficient, and aligned with user and business needs.
Key activities in the Planning phase of web development are:
 •	Defining the website’s goals and objectives
 •	Identifying the target audience and user needs
 •	Gathering and analyzing requirements
 •	Creating the sitemap and navigation structure
 •	Planning website content and features
 •	Selecting technologies and tools
 •	Estimating budget, resources, and timeline

6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly ”finished”?
Answer:The maintenance phase is iterative because it follows a repeated cycle of monitoring, updating, testing, and improving the website rather
 than occurring only once. After launch, issues are identified, fixes are applied, performance is reviewed, and changes are made based on user
 feedback or new requirements, and this process continues repeatedly. A website is never truly finished because technology evolves, security threats
 change, content needs regular updates, and user expectations grow, requiring continuous maintenance and improvement to keep the site effective and relevant.
7. Describe the process of ”Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?
Answer:Information Gathering is the process in web development where all necessary details about the website are collected before design and development begin.
 This includes understanding the website’s purpose, business goals, content requirements, competitors, technical needs, and user expectations.
 Understanding the target audience is crucial during this step because it ensures the website is designed to meet the users’ needs, preferences, 
 and behaviors. Knowing the audience helps in creating relevant content, user-friendly navigation, appealing design, and features that engage visitors effectively,
 ultimately making the website more successful.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)
8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the ”Testing” phase to save money and launch early. 
   Write a persuasive argument explaining the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase.
Answer:Skipping the Testing phase may seem like a way to save time and money, but it exposes the website to serious risks that could be far more costly in the long run.
  Without testing, security vulnerabilities may go unnoticed, leaving customer data, payment information, and business systems at risk of hacking or theft.
  Functionality issues could prevent users from completing purchases, cause broken links, or lead to errors in shopping carts, directly impacting sales and customer trust.
  Additionally, the site may have compatibility problems with different browsers, devices, or screen sizes, resulting in a poor user experience for a large portion of visitors.
  Overall, skipping testing can damage the company’s reputation, increase maintenance costs, and even result in legal or financial consequences. Investing in testing upfront
   ensures the website is safe, reliable, and performs smoothly for all user.
9. A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout.
  Analyze what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled.
Answer: The developer skipped the planning and design phases, which include creating a sitemap and design prototype. Without these steps, there was no agreed-upon structure or
  visual layout, so the client’s expectations were unclear. As a result, the coding work did not match what the client wanted, leading to rejection midway and wasted time and effort.
How it should have been handled:
 1.	Information Gathering: Understand the client’s goals, target audience, and content requirements.
 2.	Planning & Sitemap: Create a sitemap showing the website structure and navigation.
 3.	Design Prototype/Wireframe: Develop mockups or wireframes of the layout and get client approval before coding.
 4.	Approval: Only start coding after the client approves the design, ensuring expectations are aligned.

10. A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development lifecycle was neglected?
  Explain the activities involved in this phase.
Answer: The Maintenance phase involves keeping the website updated, secure, and functional after it has been launched. Activities in this phase include:
 •	Updating content regularly (like exam schedules, announcements, or news)
 •	Fixing bugs or errors that appear after launch
 •	Improving performance for faster loading and better user experience
 •	Ensuring security by applying patches and updates
 •	Adding new features based on user feedback or changing requirements
In this case, failing to update the exam schedules caused students to stop visiting, showing that ongoing maintenance is crucial for a website’s continued relevance and usefulness.
